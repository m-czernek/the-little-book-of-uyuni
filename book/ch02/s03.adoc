== Overview

In this chapter, you learned:

* A repository defines the URL, type, and other metadata of OS repositories.
* A channel groups one or multiple repositories, and links to packages defined by the repository object.
* A channel can have multiple child channels, which often link to packages that depend on packages in the parent or base channel.
* A client is assigned a single base channel, and multiple children channels.
* The process of mirroring a repository is called reposyncing.
* To register a client with {lm}, you must generate a bootstrap repository.
* A bootstrap repository generation fails typically due to the missing client tools channel, which provides for example the Salt package required for registering a client to server.
